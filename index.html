    <h2>EVAI AND UPS ACTIVE ALIGNMENT WINDOW</h2>

    <p>
      UPS operates one of the most disciplined and resilient logistics systems in the world.
      At enterprise scale, consistency and clarity form the foundation for reliability.
      Structured definitions of work allow UPS to operate across geographies, volumes,
      and operating conditions with confidence that decisions remain stable over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This discipline enables durability. It ensures that work performed today aligns
      with expectations tomorrow. It allows UPS to grow while maintaining trust across
      operations, labor, finance, and governance. The result is an organization capable
      of sustained performance at global scale.
    </p>

    <h3>STRUCTURED GOVERNANCE AND ENTERPRISE STABILITY</h3>

    <p>
      UPS relies on governed standards to translate human activity into repeatable enterprise
      outcomes. Through careful definition, review, and validation, work becomes auditable
      and dependable. This approach supports shared understanding across thousands of routes
      and facilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strength of this model lies in its consistency. Decisions become durable.
      Standards endure. Change occurs deliberately and with intention. This governance
      model contributes directly to long term operational credibility and labor stability.
    </p>

    <h3>THE STRENGTH OF DYNAMIC OBSERVATION</h3>

    <p>
      Operating environments evolve continuously. Routes change. Vehicle behavior shifts.
      Dwell accumulates incrementally. Small adjustments emerge over time and distribute
      unevenly across the network.
    </p>

    <p>
      These patterns often develop gradually and do not immediately surface through
      formal mechanisms. Over time, however, they can influence outcomes in ways that
      are difficult to attribute to a single source. This is a natural characteristic
      of operating at global scale.
    </p>

    <h3>EVAI WITHIN DAILY OPERATIONS</h3>

    <p>
      EVAI is a neutral observer with vantage that exists seamlessly within daily UPS
      operations. It does not define work, evaluate performance, or introduce new standards.
      Instead, EVAI observes how work unfolds in practice and identifies recurring patterns
      across movement, dwell, transitions, and workload context.
    </p>

    <p>
      Within this window, visibility increases while existing governance continues
      to guide outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>PURPOSE OF THE ACTIVE ALIGNMENT WINDOW</h3>

    <p>
      The Active Alignment Window establishes a limited period of shared perspective
      between EVAI and UPS. It exists to ensure that observations are interpreted within
      the context of UPS operating principles, governance models, and enterprise realities.
    </p>

    <p>
      This window supports alignment of language, framing, and intent prior to any discussion
      of systems, tooling, or integration. It ensures that insights are grounded in operational
      reality while remaining consistent with the structures that enable UPS to operate at scale.
